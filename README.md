# **Shopping Cart Application 🛒**

## ** 📌Overview 🏌️‍♀️**

This is a React.js application that simulates an e-commerce experience by interacting with the Fake Store API to fetch and display products. It features a product page, a cart page, and the ability to add/remove items from the cart, along with a dynamic total price calculation.🏌️‍♀

## **Features 🔎**

- **Product Listing Page**
  - Fetches a list of products from the Fake Store API and displays them in a responsive layout.
  - Each product card displays:
    - Product Image
    - Title
    - Price
    - Description
  - Includes an "Add to Cart" button that adds the selected product to the cart.
  - If the product is already in the cart, the button changes to "Remove from Cart," allowing the user to remove it.

- ** 🔔Cart Page 🛍️**
  - Displays all items added to the cart with detailed information:
    - Product Image
    - Title
    - Price
    - Total Price (Price × Quantity)
  - Users can adjust the quantity of each product using "Increase" and "Decrease" buttons.
  - Dynamically updates the cart's total price and applies a 10% discount on the total amount.
  - Includes a "Remove from Cart" button to delete individual items from the cart.

- **👈Routing👉**
  - Proper routing between the 📤Product Page and the Cart Page 📥 is implemented using React Router.
